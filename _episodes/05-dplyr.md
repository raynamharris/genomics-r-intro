## Why dplyr?

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read, especially for complicated operations.

Luckily, the [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr)
package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating data frames
in a way that will reduce repetition, reduce the probability of making
errors, and probably even save you some typing. As an added bonus, you might
even find the `dplyr` grammar easier to read.

Here we're going to cover some of the most commonly used functions as well as using
pipes (`%>%`) to combine them:

1. `glimpse()`
2. `select()`
3. `filter()`
4. `group_by()`
5. `summarize()`
6. `mutate()`
7. `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`

Packages in R are sets of additional functions that let you do more
stuff in R. The functions we've been using, like `str()`, come built into R;
packages give you access to more functions. You need to install a package and
then load it to be able to use it.

You only need to install a package once per computer, but you need to load it
every time you open a new R session and want to use that package.

## What is dplyr?

The package `dplyr` is a fairly new (2014) package that tries to provide easy
tools for the most common data manipulation tasks. This package is also included in the [`tidyverse` package](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which is a collection of eight different packages (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tibble`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `stringr`, and `forcats`). It is built to work directly
with data frames. The thinking behind it was largely inspired by the package
`plyr` which has been in use for some time but suffered from being slow in some
cases.` dplyr` addresses this by porting much of the computation to C++. An
additional feature is the ability to work with data stored directly in an
external database. The benefits of doing this are that the data can be managed
natively in a relational database, queries can be conducted on that database,
and only the results of the query returned.

This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted in
memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available
memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you
can have a database that is over 100s of GB, conduct queries on it directly and pull
back just what you need for analysis in R.

## Taking a quick look at data frames

Similar to `str()`, which comes built into R, `glimpse()` is a `dplyr` function that (as the name suggests) gives a glimpse of the data frame.


~~~
glimpse(variants)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in glimpse(variants): could not find function "glimpse"
~~~
{: .error}

In the above output, we can already gather some information about `variants`, such as the number of rows and columns, column names, type of vector in the columns, and the first few entries of each column. Although what we see is similar to outputs of `str()`, this method gives a cleaner visual output.

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to this function is the data frame (`variants`), and the subsequent arguments are the columns to keep.


~~~
select(variants, sample_id, REF, ALT, DP)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in select(variants, sample_id, REF, ALT, DP): could not find function "select"
~~~
{: .error}

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.


~~~
select(variants, -CHROM)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in select(variants, -CHROM): could not find function "select"
~~~
{: .error}

`dplyr` also provides useful functions to select columns based on their names. For instance, `ends_with()` allows you to select columns that ends with specific letters. For instance, if you wanted to select columns that end with the letter "B":


~~~
select(variants, ends_with("B"))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in select(variants, ends_with("B")): could not find function "select"
~~~
{: .error}

> ## Challenge
>
> Create a table that contains all the columns with the letter "i" and column "POS",
> without columns "Indiv" and "FILTER".

>> 
>> 
>> ~~~
>> Error in select(variants, contains("i"), -Indiv, -FILTER, POS): could not find function "select"
>> ~~~
>> {: .error}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

To choose rows, use `filter()`:


~~~
filter(variants, sample_id == "SRR2584863")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in filter(variants, sample_id == "SRR2584863"): object 'sample_id' not found
~~~
{: .error}

`filter()` will keep all the rows that match the conditions that are provided. Here are a few examples:


~~~
# rows for which the reference genome has T or G
filter(variants, REF %in% c("T", "G"))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in REF %in% c("T", "G"): object 'REF' not found
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
# rows with QUAL values greater than or equal to 100
filter(variants, QUAL >= 100)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in filter(variants, QUAL >= 100): object 'QUAL' not found
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
# rows that have TRUE in the column INDEL
filter(variants, INDEL)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in filter(variants, INDEL): object 'INDEL' not found
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
# rows that don't have missing data in the IDV column
filter(variants, !is.na(IDV))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in filter(variants, !is.na(IDV)): object 'IDV' not found
~~~
{: .error}

`filter()` allows you to combine multiple conditions. You can separate them using a `,` as arguments to the function, they will be combined using the `&` (AND) logical operator. If you need to use the `|` (OR) logical operator, you can specify it explicitly:


~~~
# this is equivalent to:
#   filter(variants, sample_id == "SRR2584863" & QUAL >= 100)
filter(variants, sample_id == "SRR2584863", QUAL >= 100)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in match.arg(method): object 'QUAL' not found
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
# using `|` logical operator
filter(variants, sample_id == "SRR2584863", (INDEL | QUAL >= 100))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in match.arg(method): object 'INDEL' not found
~~~
{: .error}

## Pipes

But what if you wanted to select and filter? We can do this with pipes. Pipes, are a fairly recent addition to R. Pipes let you
take the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is
useful when you need to many things to the same data set. It was
possible to do this before pipes were added to R, but it was
much messier and more difficult. Pipes in R look like
`%>%` and are made available via the `magrittr` package, which is installed as
part of `dplyr`. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you're using a PC,
or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you're using a Mac.


~~~
variants %>%
  filter(sample_id == "SRR2584863") %>%
  select(REF, ALT, DP)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in variants %>% filter(sample_id == "SRR2584863") %>% select(REF, : could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `variants` dataset first through
`filter()`, to keep rows where `sample_id` matches a particular sample, and then through `select()` to
keep only the `REF`, `ALT`, and `DP` columns. Since `%>%` takes
the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on
its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument
to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance,
in the above example, we took the data frame `variants`, *then* we `filter`ed
for rows where `sample_id` was SRR2584863, *then* we `select`ed the `REF`, `ALT`, and `DP` columns, *then* we showed only the first six rows.
The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple,
but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish
more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data we
can do so by assigning it a new name:


~~~
SRR2584863_variants <- variants %>%
  filter(sample_id == "SRR2584863") %>%
  select(REF, ALT, DP)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in variants %>% filter(sample_id == "SRR2584863") %>% select(REF, : could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}

This new object includes all of the data from this sample. Let's look at just
the first six rows to confirm it's what we want:


~~~
SRR2584863_variants
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'SRR2584863_variants' not found
~~~
{: .error}

Similar to `head()` and `tail()` functions, we can also look at the first or last six rows using tidyverse function `slice()`. Slice is a more versatile function that allows users to specify a range to view:


~~~
SRR2584863_variants %>% slice(1:6)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in SRR2584863_variants %>% slice(1:6): could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}


~~~
SRR2584863_variants %>% slice(10:25)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in SRR2584863_variants %>% slice(10:25): could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}

## Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions or find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use the `dplyr` function `mutate()`.

We have a column titled "QUAL". This is a Phred-scaled confidence
score that a polymorphism exists at this position given the sequencing
data. Lower QUAL scores indicate low probability of a polymorphism
existing at that site. We can convert the confidence value QUAL
to a probability value according to the formula:

Probability = 1- 10 ^ -(QUAL/10)

Let's add a column (`POLPROB`) to our `variants` data frame that shows
the probability of a polymorphism at that site given the data.


~~~
variants %>%
  mutate(POLPROB = 1 - (10 ^ -(QUAL/10)))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in variants %>% mutate(POLPROB = 1 - (10^-(QUAL/10))): could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}

> ## Exercise

## group_by() and  summarize() functions

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the "split-apply-combine"
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. `dplyr` makes this very easy through the use of the
`group_by()` function, which splits the data into groups. When the data is
grouped in this way `summarize()` can be used to collapse each group into
a single-row summary. `summarize()` does this by applying an aggregating
or summary function to each group. For example, if we wanted to group
by sample_id and find the number of rows of data for each
sample, we would do:


~~~
variants %>%
  group_by(sample_id) %>%
  summarize(n())
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in variants %>% group_by(sample_id) %>% summarize(n()): could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}

It can be a bit tricky at first, but we can imagine physically splitting the data
frame by groups and applying a certain function to summarize the data.

^[The figure was adapted from the Software Carpentry lesson, [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/13-dplyr/)]

Here the summary function used was `n()` to find the count for each
group. Since this is a quite a common operation, there is a simpler method
called `tally()`:


~~~
variants %>%
  group_by(ALT) %>%
  tally()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in variants %>% group_by(ALT) %>% tally(): could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}

To show that there are many ways to achieve the same results, there is another way to approach this, which bypasses `group_by()` using the function `count()`:


~~~
variants %>%
  count(ALT)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in variants %>% count(ALT): could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}

> ## Challenge
>
> * How many mutations are found in each sample?

>>   count(sample_id)
>> ~~~
>> {: .language-r}
>> 
>> 
>> 
>> ~~~
>> Error in variants %>% count(sample_id): could not find function "%>%"
>> ~~~
>> {: .error}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

We can also apply many other functions to individual columns to get other
summary statistics. For example,we can use built-in functions like `mean()`,
`median()`, `min()`, and `max()`. These are called "built-in functions" because
they come with R and don't require that you install any additional packages.
By default, all **R functions operating on vectors that contains missing data will return NA**.
It's a way to make sure that users know they have missing data, and make a
conscious decision on how to deal with it. When dealing with simple statistics
like the mean, the easiest way to ignore `NA` (the missing data) is
to use `na.rm = TRUE` (`rm` stands for remove).

So to view the mean, median, maximum, and minimum filtered depth (`DP`) for each sample:


~~~
variants %>%
  group_by(sample_id) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_DP = mean(DP),
    median_DP = median(DP),
    min_DP = min(DP),
    max_DP = max(DP))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in variants %>% group_by(sample_id) %>% summarize(mean_DP = mean(DP), : could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}

## Reshaping data frames

It can sometimes be useful to transform the "long" tidy format, into the wide format. This transformation can be done with the `pivot_wider()` function provided by the `tidyr` package (also part of the `tidyverse`).

`pivot_wider()` takes a data frame as the first argument, and two arguments: the column name that will become the columns  and the column name that will become the cells in the wide data.


~~~
variants_wide <- variants %>%
  group_by(sample_id, CHROM) %>%
  summarize(mean_DP = mean(DP)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample_id, values_from = mean_DP)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in variants %>% group_by(sample_id, CHROM) %>% summarize(mean_DP = mean(DP)) %>% : could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
variants_wide
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'variants_wide' not found
~~~
{: .error}

The opposite operation of `pivot_wider()` is taken care by `pivot_longer()`. We specify the names of the new columns, and here add `-CHROM` as this column shouldn't be affected by the reshaping:


~~~
variants_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(-CHROM, names_to = "sample_id", values_to = "mean_DP")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in variants_wide %>% pivot_longer(-CHROM, names_to = "sample_id", : could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}
